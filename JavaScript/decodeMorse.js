GitHub Copilot: The provided code is a JavaScript function called `decodeMorse` that takes in a string [`morseCode`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%5D "JavaScript/decodeMorse.js") as its parameter. The purpose of this function is to decode Morse code and return the corresponding English text.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The first line of the function [`return morseCode.trim().split('   ')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%5D "JavaScript/decodeMorse.js") trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the [`morseCode`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Frichardyvarra%2FDesktop%2Falgoriddims%2FJavaScript%2FdecodeMorse.js%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%5D "JavaScript/decodeMorse.js") string and then splits it into an array of words. In Morse code, words are separated by three spaces.

2. The `map` function is then called on the array of words. This function takes in a callback function that will be executed for each word in the array. Inside the callback function, the word is split into an array of letters using the space character as the delimiter.

3. Another `map` function is called on the array of letters. This function takes in a callback function that will be executed for each letter in the array. Inside the callback function, the `MORSE_CODE` object is used to look up the corresponding English letter for each Morse code letter.

4. The `join('')` function is called on the array of letters to concatenate them into a single string representing a word in English.

5. The `join(' ')` function is called on the array of words to concatenate them into a single string representing the decoded English text. The words are separated by a single space.

6. Finally, the decoded English text is returned from the function.

It's important to note that the code assumes the existence of a `MORSE_CODE` object, which is not shown in the provided code selection. This object is likely defined elsewhere in the code or in an external library, and it maps Morse code letters to their corresponding English letters.

Overall, this function takes a Morse code string, splits it into words and letters, looks up the corresponding English letters using the `MORSE_CODE` object, and returns the decoded English text.
